# Star Wars Dataset Analysis in R

## Project Overview

This project explores the `starwars` dataset using various data analysis techniques in R. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization, and clustering to extract meaningful insights and categorize characters.

## Features Implemented

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Checked for missing and infinite values  
  - Converted non-numeric columns where possible  
  - Removed rows with missing data  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  - Computed summary statistics (min, max, mean, mode)  
  - Visualized numerical attributes using boxplots  

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  - Applied clustering on cleaned numeric attributes  
  - Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters  
  - Visualized results and identified patterns  
## Technologies Used

- R  
- dplyr  
- ggplot2  
- reshape2  


## Results
This project provides insights into the dataset through statistical measures and clustering outcomes. The visualization of numeric attributes and clustering results helps understand patterns among Star Wars characters
